    "PokemonGo is a mobile augmented reality game developed by Niantic inc. for iOS, Android, and Apple Watch devices, initially released in July 2016. In the game, players use a mobile device's GPS capability to interact with virtual creatures called Pokemin. With the help of augmented reality, users are able to see Pokemon on the screen as if they were in the same real-world location as the player. In this presentation, we will view how the use of data science can help users predict the next occurance of a pokemon based on the given information gathered to data."

    "The dataset that we have for predicting occurences of Pokemon at the moment has about 300,000 entries on Pokemon appearences and about 208 columns of information. Using data science techniques, we will be dropping the number of entries to just the appearences in the United States. The 208 columns bring information on geography, appearences with other Pokemon, and location relative to ingame landmarks."
