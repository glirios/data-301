    "> I've been thinking about the *why* and *how* of connecting introductory statistics to machine learning. Of course, one reason why is to put statistics more solidly in the emerging mainstream of data science. Another reason is motivated in part by the views expressed in the American Statistical Association's recent statement on the over-use of p-values. Although p-values are a leading character in the last half of a \"consensus\" statistics text, you'll hardly ever see a p-value in an exposition of machine learning.  But this talk will be about still another reason, which has to do with the \"how.\" In this talk, I'll demonstrate that using a machine-learning approach can streamline the technical apparatus of introductory statistics, pointing to many confusing technical components of the \"consensus course\" that can be eliminated.  I'll lay out ten relatively simple \"objects\" that can be combined into a solid basis for statistical thinking as well as providing a shorter and smoother path to the multivariate statistics learning goals emphasized in the new GAISE College Report.\n",
